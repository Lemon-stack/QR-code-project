# QR-code-project
I made a QR code card In reference to a community task project
This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
The use of CSS selectors more for clean codes, scalability and easy readability.

Avoiding unnecessary repetitions and codes.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on JavaScript concepts like loops, functions, methods etc.
I still have some difficulties when using these concepts. Understanding them is quite important to me!
More especially, frameworks like React, Vue Js and many more are things look forward to master!
